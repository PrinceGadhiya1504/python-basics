# Inheritance allows us to define a class that inherits all the methods and properties from another class.
# Parent class is the class being inherited from, also called base class.
# Child class is the class that inherits from another class, also called derived class.

# Create a Parent Class
class Person:
    def __init__(self, fname, lname):
        self.firstname = fname
        self.lastname = lname
    
    def printname(self):
        print(self.firstname, self.lastname)

p1 = Person("Prince", "Gadhiya")
p1.printname()

# Create a Child Class
# To create a class that inherits the functionality from another class, send the parent class as a parameter when creating the child class
class Student(Person):
    pass
# Note: Use the pass keyword when we don't want to add any other properties or methods to the class.

# Now the Student class has the same properties and methods as the Person class.
child = Person("Harshil", "Patel")
child.printname()

# Add the __init__() Function
# So far we have created a child class that inherits the properties and methods from its parent.
# We want to add the __init__() function to the child class (instead of the pass keyword).
# Note: The __init__() function is called automatically every time the class is being used to create a new object.

# When we add the __init__() function, the child class will no longer inherit the parent's __init__() function.
# Note: The child's __init__() function overrides the inheritance of the parent's __init__() function.
# To keep the inheritance of the parent's __init__() function, add a call to the parent's __init__() function:
class Student(Person):
    def __init__(self, fname, lname):
        Person.__init__(self, fname, lname)
# Now we have successfully added the __init__() function, and kept the inheritance of the parent class, and 
# we are ready to add functionality in the __init__() function.

# Use the super() Function
# Python also has a super() function that will make the child class inherit all the methods and properties from its parent:
class Student(Person):
  def __init__(self, fname, lname):
    super().__init__(fname, lname)
# By using the super() function, we do not have to use the name of the parent element, 
# it will automatically inherit the methods and properties from its parent.

# Add Properties
# Add a property called graduationyear to the Student class:
class Student(Person):
    def __init__(self, fname, lname):
        super().__init__(fname, lname)
        self.graduationyear = 2023
# In the example below, the year 2023 should be a variable, and passed into the Student class when creating student objects. 
# To do so, add another parameter in the __init__() function:
class Student(Person):
  def __init__(self, fname, lname, year):
    super().__init__(fname, lname)
    self.graduationyear = year

x = Student("Prince", "Gadhiya", 2023)
print(x.graduationyear)

# Add Methods
# Add a method called welcome to the Student class
class Student(Person):
  def __init__(self, fname, lname, year):
    super().__init__(fname, lname)
    self.graduationyear = year

  def welcome(self):
    print("Welcome", self.firstname, self.lastname, "to the class of", self.graduationyear)

p1 = Student("Prince", "Gadhiya", 2023)
p1.welcome()
